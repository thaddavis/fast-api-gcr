# TLDR

Build a simple FastAPI

- https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/

## Spiel

OK, we're NOT focusing on building a crazy API here, but instead focusing on the generall process of deploying dockerized containers to GCP / GCR

## PART 2a - Scaffold out application

- Let's create a super simple FastAPI (which just entails adding a few files and folders to our project)...

- `touch requirements.txt` <!-- populate with `READMEs/2.requirements.txt` -->
- `mkdir src`
- `touch src/main.py` <!-- populate with `READMEs/2.main.py` -->
- `mkdir src/smokeTest`
- `touch src/smokeTest/router.py`
- `echo "from .router import *" >> src/smokeTest/__init__.py`

## PART 2b - Install Python Packages

- ie: Notice how our imports are throwing warnings saying something along the lines of "could not be resolved"
- This is because we have NOT installed yet
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï - and now we can CMD + click to inspect our 3rd-party packages and our warnings go away

## PART 2c - Run the FastAPI

- `uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4000 --reload`
- `http://localhost:4000/smoke-test/hello-world`

## PART 2d - Testing out debugpy

- Add Configuration...
- Remote Attach (Attach to a remote debug server)...
        - localhost:5678
- Then test out breakpoint debugging

<!-- 
    REMINDER: We're focusing on the overall process of deploying a dockerized FastAPI to GCR so watch the whole video first.
    
    ALSO NOTE: Don't be discouraged if you run into technical issues when you trying this yourself.
-->

## FOR EXAMPLE some issues I ran into were

### Exhibit A
 
Needing to manually kill the breakpoint debugging server a few times

```
netstat -nlp|grep 5678
kill <PID>
```

### Exhibit B

Needing to stop, delete, and rebuild the "Dev Container" when things didn't behave as expected etc.

- show how to do so with "Docker Desktop"

<!--
    IDEALLY you'll have no issues but I find that expection to be unrealistic when it comes to development.

## NEXT STEPS

OK! Now that we've finished developing our API, let's ship it to the world üåê
