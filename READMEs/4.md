# TLDR

Set up CICD (w/ GitHub Actions)

## Spiel

There are many tools you can use for automating your deployment steps but for simple demonstration purposes we'll go with GitHub Actions

## PART 4a

- You'll need to authenticate your machine to GitHub when storing code in your account
- so I will add an SSH key to the container
- REFERENCE: `https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account`
- `vi ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- `vi ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- `chmod 600 /root/.ssh/id_ed25519`

## PART 4b

Now let's push our code to GitHub...

- BEFORE: `https://github.com/thaddavis/fast-api-gcr/actions`
- Push your code to GitHub
- `git push -u origin main`
- AFTER: inspect what the GitHub UI is saying

## PART 4c

GitHub will look for special files when triggering "Actions" and is how we create these files...

- `mkdir -p .github/workflows`
- `touch .github/workflows/cicd.yaml` <!-- populate with `4.cicd.yaml` -->
- https://dev.to/rushi-patel/deploy-next-js-app-to-google-cloud-run-with-github-actions-cicd-a-complete-guide-l29
- Create serviceAccount to authenticate GitHub to GCP on your behalf
- https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?hl=en&project=h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r
- Configure all the "Secrets" that are be used by the CICD script
- ie: `https://github.com/thaddavis/fast-api-gcr/settings/secrets/actions`
    - GCP_SA_KEY
- View CICD here: https://github.com/thaddavis/fast-api-gcr/actions

<!--
    REMINDER: Technical issues happen, so if the CICD pipeline doesn't work immediately GitHub will show you the build logs to assist you in troubleshooting
-->

## FOR EXAMPLE

For example, I ran into issues where the serviceAccount needed additional permissions...

```
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r \
    --member="serviceAccount:htddfatgcr@h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/artifactregistry.writer"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r \
  --member="serviceAccount:htddfatgcr@h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/run.admin"

gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r \
  --member="serviceAccount:htddfatgcr@h-t-d-a-f-a-t-g-c-r.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountUser"
```
