# TLDR

Create a Dev Container

- https://containers.dev/

## Spiel

"Dev Containers" are a specification being developed at Microsoft that allows you to attach an IDE to a Docker container containing your development environment.

At the time of recording, the only IDE's that have solid support for "Dev Containers" are VSCode & IntelliJ. So if you don't use VSCode or IntelliJ this video is probably not for you.

## Prereqs

To easily follow along, you'll need at least a rudimentary understanding of the following tools/concepts...

- Docker
    - `https://www.docker.com/get-started/`
- Docker Desktop
    - Docker Desktop is a GUI the makes aspects of using Docker a bit easier
    - FYI, I think `Docker Desktop` gets installed when you install Docker
- VSCode
    - ie: the world's most popular application for editing code
    - https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html
- VSCode extensions
    - which augment the functionality of VSCode
    - ie: particularly you'll need at least
        - the "Docker" extension: `code --install-extension ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`
        - the "Dev Containers" extension" `code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`
    - installing the "Dev Containers" extension should take only a few clicks and a few seconds
    - `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`
- & general software development concepts like .git, CLI commands, & HTTP APIs
- We'll be developing and deploying a simple Python FastAPI in this video BUT if you're familiar with other frameworks [like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Flask] you should still be able to follow along

## PART 1

- Here we are, starting from scratch, ie: an empty folder
- Let's start by creating a `.devcontainer` folder at the root of the project
    - `mkdir .devcontainer`
- Inside of this folder, let's create an empty file called `devcontainer.json`
    - `touch .devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- What should we put in this file you might ask?
    - Well if we take a look at the official "Dev Container" spec (`https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/`), we'll see all of the individual keys we COULD specify
    - ie: run `smoothScrollToBottom(50000);` in JavaScript console
- But, to get us moving along, I'll just paste in this .json content
    - ie: `1.devcontainer.json`
- What's going on here you might ask?
    - ie: Walk through the properties in the `devcontainer.json` file
    - COOL VISUALIZATION: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers`

<!-- ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï Docker is a complex tool that offers many ways to use it for accomplishing your goals. So DON'T get bogged down in the details & instead focus on the overall process being highlighted across the 4 parts of this video -->

- Next we add the Dockerfile referenced on line 4 that will include MOST of the software we'll need for developing our application (ie: our FastAPI)
    - ie: `1.Dockerfile.dev`
    - ie: Click through to inspect the Dockerfile parent (functionality powered by the "Docker" VSCode extension)
- OK! Enough theory. Let's run our "Devcontainer"
        - note how the image is based on debian linux
    - w/ VSCODE, assuming you have the "Dev Containers" extension installed, you should be able to type `Shift + CMD + P` to open the command "palette" and locate a command called `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
    - ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï I like opening "Dev Containers" like this via the UI, but just for the super nerds, I included a script, called `open-devcontainer.js`, that shows how to open a "Dev Container" from the command line <!-- Note that running this will require Node.js to be installed on your machine -->
    - the 1st time you run a Docker container the process will tend to be slow BUT because Docker caches a lot of information on your behalf, subsequent runs of your container will tend to be faster
    - Also note, that if you edit the Dockerfile you are using for your development environment, then you will need to rebuild the "Dev Container"
    - ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï - The final detail to note is how we are basing our development environment off of a container that includes Python but that intentionally removes a lot of unecessary software (to keep our development environment lightweight)
    
    - SMOKE TEST the "Dev Container"
        - git version
        - curl --version
        - python --version
        - cat /etc/os-release
    - üî•

## NEXT STEPS (Cut to speaker)

Setting up this "Dev Container" is the 1st step of our larger goal of deploying a FastAPI to GCR.

The high-level outline of what we're really doing here is...

A) building something cool and then
B) sharing it with the world (as quickly, cheaply, and simply as possible)

In the next sections we'll continue by...

‚àö PART I - Create a Dev Container
-> PART II - Build a simple FastAPI - ie: building the FastAPI
-> PART III - Deploy the API to GCR - ie: then deploying it
-> PART IV - Set up CICD (w/ GitHub Actions) - ie: and finally setting up a simple CICD pipeline
