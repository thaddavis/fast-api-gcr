# TLDR

Creating a devcontainer

- https://containers.dev/

## Spiel

"Devcontainers" are a specification being developed at Microsoft that allows you to attach an IDE to a Docker container containing your development environment.

At the time of recording, the only IDE's that have solid support for "Devcontainers" are VSCode & IntelliJ. So if you don't use VSCode or IntelliJ this probably is not for you.

## Prereqs

You'll need at least a rudimentary understanding of the following tools or concepts to easily follow along...

- Docker
    - `https://www.docker.com/get-started/`
- Docker Desktop
    - I think `Docker Desktop` get installed when you install Docker but yea I'll be using it as a tool to show what's going on throughout
- VSCode
    - ie: the world's most popular application for editing code
    - https://pypl.github.io/IDE.html
- VSCode extensions 
    - ie: particularly you'll need 
        - the "Docker" extension: `code --install-extension ms-azuretools.vscode-docker`
        - the "Dev Containers" extension" `code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`
    - installing the "Dev Containers" extension should take only a few clicks and a few seconds
    - `https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`
- & finally an understanding of general development concepts like .git, CLI commands, & HTTP APIs will be needed for following along
- We'll be developing a Python FastAPI in this video but if you're familiar with other frameworks [like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Flask etc.] you'll still be able to follow along

## PART 1

- Here we are, starting from scratch, ie: an empty folder
- Let's start by creating a `.devcontainer` folder at the root of the project
    - `mkdir .devcontainer`
- Inside of this folder, let's create an empty file called `devcontainer.json`
    - `touch .devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- What should we put in this file you might ask?
    - Well if we take a look at the official "Devcontainer" spec (`https://containers.dev/implementors/json_reference/`), we'll see all of the individual keys we could specify
    - ie: run `smoothScrollToBottom(50000);` in JavaScript console
- But I'll just paste in this .json content to get us moving along
    - ie: `1.devcontainer.json`
- What's going on here you might ask?
    - ie: Walk through the properties in the `devcontainer.json` file
    - COOL VISUALIZATION: `https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers`
- The last thing we'll need to do for now is add the Dockerfile (referenced on line 4) that includes MOST of the software we'll need for developing our application (ie: our FastAPI)
    - ie: `1.Dockerfile.dev`
- OK! Enough theory. Let's run our "Devcontainer"
    - w/ VSCODE, assuming you have the "Dev Containers" extension installed, you should be able to type `Shift + CMD + P` to open the command "palette" and locate a command called `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`
    - ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï I like opening "Dev Containers" via the UI, but just for the super nerds, I included a script called `open-devcontainer.js` that shows how to open a "Dev Container" from the command line <!-- running this will require Node.js to be installed -->
    - ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï - the 1st time you run a Docker container the process will tend to be slow BUT because Docker caches a lot of information on your behalf, subsequent runs will tend to be much faster
    - ‚ùïNOTE‚ùï - Another detail to note is how we are basing our development environment off of a container that includes Python but that intentionally removes a lot of unecessary software to speed us up a bit
    
    - SMOKE TEST the "Dev Container"
        - git version
        - curl --version
        - python --version
    - üî•

## NEXT STEPS

Ok! What we've just done with this "Dev Container" stuff is the 1st step of our larger goal of deploying a FastAPI to GCR.

The high-level outline of what we're really doing here is A) building something cool and then B) sharing it with the world as quickly and cheaply as possible

So in parts 2 & 3 we will continue by...

PART I - Creating a Dev Container
-> PART II - Building a simple FastAPI
-> PART III - Deploying an API to GCR
